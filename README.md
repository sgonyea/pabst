Pabst: Protocol Buffers for Riak
================================

You'll need to install ObjFW in order to use this:

https://webkeks.org/objfw/

or at my mirror:

ObjFW is a wonderful cross-platform Objective-C library, which I have used to build this Ruby Extension.

Much more work is yet to be done, so please stay tuned.
